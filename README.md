This is a program that will allow the user to interface with ChatGPT.

In order to use this program, you need your own API key. When you import this repository, add a new file.
Name this new file ".env", without the quotation marks.
Copy the following text into the .env file:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=

After that, simply paste your API key. No spaces or new lines are necessary.
This will charge your account for your use of the listed GPT model, which in this case is gpt-4o-2024-08-06.
